=== SDK Release 3.1.0.0 31 Aug 2020
! Minimum Versions increased:
  Windows to Windows 7
  Android to Lollipop (5.0, API Level 21)

! AGC is now on playback
! iOS and MacOS client libraries are now delivered as frameworks for improved
  convenience
! If you already have an sdk license issued before 2018, you need to contact
  sales at bizdev@teamspeak.com to upgrade your license in order for it to work reliably on this SDK
+ Added Armv7, Armv8 client and server on Linux
+ New audio dsp algorithms for Automatic Gain Control, Comfort Noise, Denoiser
  and Echo Cancellation
+ Added Echo Reduction Ducker and Typing Suppression algorithms
+ Client SDK: onEditCapturedVoiceDataPreprocessEvent
+ Client SDK: TEST_MODE_TALK_STATUS_CHANGES_ONLY to LocalTestMode enumeration
+ Client SDK: getWhisperReceiveWhitelist, isWhisperReceiveWhitelisted,
              setWhisperReceiveWhitelist
+ Client SDK: setKeyPressedDuringChunk, getGlobalConfigValueAsInt,
              setGlobalConfigValue
+ ChannelProperties: CHANNEL_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER
* Client SDK: requestClientMove, requestClientKickFromChannel,
              requestClientKickFromServer now take an array of client IDs
* Client SDK: requestServerVariables now accepts a return code

=== SDK Release 3.0.4.4 30 May 2018
+ Added Android and iOS soundbackends
  System requirements: iOS 10 or later, Android 4.1 or later
+ Android got two soundbackends to choose from:
  1) OpenSL ES C++ based (see examples/client_android), which is delivered as a native shared library.
  2) AudioRecord Java based (see examples/client_android_javasound), which is delivered as Kotlin source code.
+ Added samples to demonstrate mobile soundbackends
* Updated Android JNI wrapper, new function ts3client_android_initJni to initialize the TeamSpeak
  native library in one step

=== SDK Release 3.0.4 27 Feb 2016
+ Added IPv6 support
+ Added ts3client_startConnectionWithChannelID to clientlib to allow specifying the default channel
  as ID
+ Added get/set channel/client variables as uint64 to serverlib
+ Added 64 bit platform support for android
+ Added a new server API call "ts3server_createVirtualServer2" that will create one virtual server
  with all the required channels configured in one call. See the documentation for more details,
  and our new server_creation_params example
+ Added new logtarget LogType_SYSLOG. Does not work on Windows. Logs to system syslog facility.
+ Added TEST_MODE_VOICE_LOCAL_AND_REMOTE status for ts3client_setLocalTestMode. In this mode, the
  client hears both its own input, and the sound of remote clients.
* public_errors.h now defines the error codes as enums, instead of const unsigned int, to make it
  easier to include this file in c projects
* Reimplemented file transfer code
* ts3client_getTransferFilePath and ts3client_getTransferFileRemotePath do now not return a
  trailing '/' character
! Starting this release we have a new directory structure. For all platforms the shared libraries
  (dll/so/dylib) are in bin directry, and static libraries (.lib/.a) are in lib directory
! Starting this release we have dropped the platform suffix for the ts3client and ts3server
  libraries. For example ts3client_win32.dll and ts3client_win64.dll are now both called
  ts3client.dll and are located in different directories
! 3.0.4 will be the last sdk supporting windows xp
- Lots of other internal improvements that came from TeamSpeak 3.1 client and 3.0.13 server

=== SDK Release 3.0.3.2 29 Jun 2015
- Fixed issue with offline licenses
- Fixed utf8 conversion issues with invalid utf8 strings
- Fixed windows audio session backend error reporting issues

=== SDK Release 3.0.3.1 24 Apr 2015
! Fixed critical bug causing SDK license not being accepted
- Fixed missing build number on FreeBSD server

=== SDK Release 3.0.3 30 Mar 2015
! Callbacks in the client are now asynchronous
+ Added Opus voice codec
+ Added SecuritySalt/SecurityHash mechanism. Note this makes 3.0.3 and 3.0.2
  clients/servers incompatible.
+ Server can disable selected client commands
+ Added callbacks for lots of server function to enable custom permissions
+ Added custom password checks.
+ Added new CHANNEL_DELETE_DELAY param for server side channel creation
+ Added filetransfer support
+ Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS) are now included in the TeamSpeak SDK package
+ Android: Added x86 support
+ iOS: Added armv7s and arm64 to device and x86_64 to simulator
+ iOS: Changed std lib from libstdc++ to libc++
* Updated example projects to Visual Studio 2013

=== SDK Release 3.0.2 15 May 2012
+ Added function calls for communication with a provisioning server, which is
  only available in special scenarios on request
- onUpdateClientEvent callback now passes an invoker block for the cases where
  a client was updated by somebody else than himself
- numerous bug fixes and performance improvements

=== SDK Release 3.0.1 14 Sep 2011
+ Update Client Example to include recording of playback data to *.wav file.
- Fix bug that led to the channelSpeakerArray in audio callbacks to contain
  the wrong value
- Fix bug that could lead to client crashes in channels with a
  latency_factor of 2 or higher


=== SDK Release 3.0.0 05 Aug 2011
! New sound system added. The fmod libraries needed previously are no longer
  required to be deployed. Instead the client side now requires a
  "soundbackends" folder with a few platform dependent sound backends.
! The ts3client_initClientLib function now requires an additional parameter: A
  path where to find the "soundbackends" folder.
! The 3.0.0 SDK server requires 3.0.0 SDK clients, and vice versa. You should
  not mix older (-betaX) builds with 3.0.0 or higher builds.
* Most sound related function calls have changed, since the "modeID" now a
  string instead of an integer
* Voice data packet encryption is now configurable to save CPU on huge servers,
  see the "VIRTUALSERVER_CODEC_ENCRYPTION_MODE" setting to set it.
* Reduced CPU usage on the server side, especially for large servers
* requestChannel(Un)subscribe now takes an array of {client,channel}IDs instead
  of only one ID.
+ Added callbacks that allow you to view and change sound data as it passes
  through the playback and capture chain. This allows great flexibility:
  Recording Audio at various stages, applying sound effects or filters are just
  some of the new possibilities.
+ Echo cancellation added
+ Added "CustomDevice" functions that allow you to implement capture and
  playback your own way, you will need to feed in audio (capture) and retrieve
  audio (playback) regularly. See new custom device example for details.
+ Added ability to playback wave files
- numerous bug fixes and performance improvements

=== SDK Release 3.0.0-beta6 02 Jul 2010
- Fix bug in sdk server that had disabled the talk status callbacks
- Fix bug that lead to some normal channel based chatting not reaching all
  clients in the channel

=== SDK Release 3.0.0-beta5 10 Jun 2010
! The beta5 sdk server requires beta5 sdk clients, and the beta5 sdk client
  requires a beta5 sdk server. You should not mix older sdk builds with beta5
  builds.
- Greatly improved the whispering code. It is now possible to whisper to
  clients that do not have you in view. Also note that you need to explicitly
  allow any incoming whispers, use the new allowWhispersFrom function (possibly
  from within the onIgnoredWhisperEvent callback)
- onTalkStatusChangeEvent now has a isReceivedWhisper parameter telling you if
  this is a whisper message or regular non whisper communication.
- Channel Codec now has an additional parameter, the codec latency factor. The
  default is 1, which results in the same behavior as pre beta5. Higher values
  lead to less voice packets sent per second meaning higher delay but less
  bandwidth usage.
- server side onTextMessageEvent callback split into two callbacks, one for
  messages to the server, one for messages to a channel
- numerous bug fixes and performance improvements

!skipped beta4

=== SDK Release 3.0.0-beta3 27 Jan 2010
! The beta3 sdk server requires beta3 sdk clients, you cannot connect to a new
  beta3 sdk server with an older sdk client.
! Switched channelIDs, logIDs, serverIDs, serverConnectionHandlerIDs, banIDs,
  offlineMessageIDs from anyID to uint64
* changed parameters of onTextMessageEvent
+ added new onServerProtocolEvent callback that triggers uppon connect telling
  you which protocol version the server is running
- numerous bug fixes and performance improvements

=== SDK Release 3.0.0-beta2 20 Dec 2009
* CLIENT_OUTPUT_MUTED will now mute both speakers and microphone, if really
  want to mute the headphones only, use the new CLIENT_OUTPUTONLY_MUTED flag

=== SDK Release 3.0.0-beta1 19 Dec 2009
* Initial beta release
